# AL AMIN's Portfolio


## Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for **AL AMIN BHUIYAN**, a Full Stack Developer.  
The site showcases my skills, experience, and contact information in a clean, responsive, and modern design.  

It's built as a **single-page application (SPA)** using pure **HTML and CSS**, emphasizing semantic structure, accessibility, and best practices for web development.

The project demonstrates fundamental web technologies while incorporating creative elements like **custom fonts, animations, and a professional layout**. It was developed to highlight my expertise in creating user-friendly interfaces without relying on JavaScript frameworks, focusing on performance and maintainability.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using CSS media queries.  
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for better SEO and accessibility.  
- **Custom Styling**: Includes a unique font (`seenonim-v1`), CSS variables for theming, and subtle animations (fade-in effects on sections via CSS keyframes).  
- **Navigation**: Smooth anchor links to sections (Home, Skills, Contact) without JavaScript.  
- **Contact Form**: Functional form that opens the user's email client for sending messages (using `mailto:` protocol). Includes required fields, labels, and basic validation via HTML attributes.  
- **Hero Section**: Engaging introduction with buttons for **Hire Me** (links to Contact) and **Get CV** (downloads a PDF placeholder).  
- **Skills Showcase**: Categorized list of skills with hover effects for interactivity.  
- **Footer**: Includes quick links, services, social media icons (with ARIA labels for accessibility), and contact details.  
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Alt text for images, focus outlines for interactive elements, and high-contrast colors.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ For structure and semantics.  
- **CSS3** â€“ For styling, layouts (Flexbox), animations, and responsiveness.  
- **Custom Font** â€“ Loaded via `@font-face` from the `fonts/` directory.  
- **No JavaScript** â€“ Relies purely on HTML/CSS for all functionality and interactivity.
